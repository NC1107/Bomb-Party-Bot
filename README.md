# Bomb Party Helper
This is a simple helper to help you when you get stuck while playing Bomb Party, This project is also for educational purposes, using this can result in a ban(probably).

## Installation

1. Download the project files (or release if I get around to making one)
2. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pynput re pyautogui
```
if you have any issues installing multiple libraries at once try doing it one at a time.

## Usage
 * Go to this website [here](https://JKLM.FUN)  
 * Run the script(read the directions)  
 * when its your turn type the phrase given to you in the center, for example ("en","at","ic", etc.)  
 * after typing the phrase hit "+" and wait for a word to be returned:  
     * if the word is not correct hit "-" and type the phrase again  
     * the same word will not get chosen twice.  
```
+ : searches for a phrase in the textbox
- : clears the saved phrase (hit this key after each turn or failed word.)
```

I'm not a great programmer so I'm sure there are bugs, I made this in 20 minutes to beat my friends.(the ReadMe is taking longer to make)
So any suggestions on how to improve/ or bug fixes are welcome.
